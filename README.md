<!-- Abstract -->
## Abstract
A child’s drawing is ruined by spilled water, but a robot offers to recreate it using AI. This study explores AI-assisted creativity, integrating text-to-image models like DALL-E 3 and Visual ChatGPT to enhance artistic collaboration, prompt adherence, and co-creativity in human-machine interactions. Our findings highlight AI’s generation in creative restoration.

AI is transforming the creation of Yonkoma (4-Koma) manga by combining traditional storytelling with modern technology. Yonkoma manga, which began in early 20th-century Japan, tells short but powerful stories in four panels. Originally hand-drawn and later digitized, it integrates AI tools to improve the process.
Advanced AI models like DALL-E 3 generate high-quality manga images from text descriptions[1]. This helps maintain a consistent artistic style across panels. Additionally, Visual ChatGPT allows artists to refine AI-generated images by providing feedback and adjusting[2].
AI improves manga production by making it faster, more flexible, and more precise. However, challenges remain, such as ensuring visual consistency and aligning images with the story. Artists save AI settings and structured prompts to solve this, ensuring results can be refined and repeated​[3].
This study explores how AI is changing Yonkoma manga. By automating repetitive tasks, AI allows artists to focus more on storytelling, expanding creative possibilities while maintaining the manga’s unique style. As AI technology evolves, it will be key in enhancing efficiency and artistic expression. AI’s impact on digital manga creation is expected to grow, shaping the future of manga production and innovation. Combining AI instead of traditional methods will redefine the creative process for artists.


## Methodology
[![4-comma][images-fig3]](https://example.com)

*Figure 3. This story is about a child and a girl. It is made step by step using DALL-E 3 AI. Each part of the story has clear text, and OpenAI makes the pictures from it.*


The story is divided into four sections to integrate AI-driven creativity into a 4-Koma (Yonkoma) manga, with a key sentence for each representing a panel. This structured approach helps maintain narrative clarity and allows for effective visual production.
The process begins by defining and breaking the main idea into four structured descriptions. Each description includes essential details about composition, character expressions, and the overall scene setting. These structured descriptions are then fed into DALL-E 3, a model selected for its high accuracy in following text instructions and generating high-quality, visually appealing images.
Additionally, Visual ChatGPT is employed to refine the generated images gradually, ensuring consistency in artistic style across all panels. This method is chosen over manual drawing because AI-based tools provide faster iterations, enhanced creative flexibility, and improved precision. AI models like DALL-E 3 can generate well-aligned, accurate images when guided by detailed prompts and structured input. To ensure that others can understand the results of this process, all AI-generated images from OpenAI were carefully documented to make it easy to reproduce the same method. This study demonstrates that blending structured storytelling with AI-generated visuals significantly enhances creative collaboration between humans and machines, paving the way for future innovations.

## Result and Future Work
A Yonkoma (4-Koma) manga was created, successfully conveying a complete story in just a few frames. Key sentences were defined to emphasize plot points, and through interactive sessions, images were generated to maintain the narrative flow, resembling a dynamic movie sequence. If the project were to be repeated, additional AI models would be incorporated to achieve more diverse visual outputs. Detailed images were effectively produced when clear, step-by-step guidance was provided. For future projects, a more extensive story will be developed, and a short film adaptation will be created using multiple AI tools to enhance creativity and ensure artistic consistency.

## Conclusion
This study shows how AI changes Yonkoma manga creation. The most interesting part was how AI keeps the art style the same while improving storytelling. By using clear prompts and refining images step by step, AI helps creativity. In the future, AI will expand artistic possibilities and reshape human-machine collaboration.

<!-- Abstract -->
## Abstract
A child’s drawing is ruined by spilled water, but a robot offers to recreate it using AI. This study explores AI-assisted creativity, integrating text-to-image models like DALL-E 3 and Visual ChatGPT to enhance artistic collaboration, prompt adherence, and co-creativity in human-machine interactions. Our findings highlight AI’s generation in creative restoration.
Example of how to make a list:
There are many great README templates available on GitHub.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

<!-- Introduction and Related Works -->
## Introduction and Related Works

The AI is used in 4-Koma (Yonkoma) manga to mix old storytelling with new technology. Yonkoma manga started in Japan in the early 20th century. It is famous because it tells short but strong stories in four panels. In the past, it was drawn by hand for newspapers, but later, it became digital. AI can also be used to make it, creating new ways to produce manga.
The reason for using AI is that Yonkoma manga has a simple and structured way of telling a story. AI-generated images help automate the process and keep the style the same across all panels. Instead of drawing by hand, DALL-E 3 makes high-quality images based on descriptions. Then, Visual ChatGPT is used to fix the images, ensuring they look more connected and consistent.
AI is better than manual drawing because it is faster, more flexible, and more precise. However, there are problems, such as ensuring all images match the story and maintaining artistic consistency. All text prompts and AI settings are saved to fix this so others can repeat the process correctly.
AI-generated images have greatly improved, from simple pictures to highly detailed artwork. This study shows that AI can help creativity and introduce new ways to make manga stories.

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries used to bootstrap your project. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.

## Methodology

The story is divided into four sections to integrate AI-driven creativity into a 4-Koma (Yonkoma) manga, with a key sentence for each representing a panel. This structured approach helps maintain narrative clarity and allows for effective visual production.
The process begins by defining and breaking the main idea into four structured descriptions. Each description includes essential details about composition, character expressions, and the overall scene setting. These structured descriptions are then fed into DALL-E 3, a model selected for its high accuracy in following text instructions and generating high-quality, visually appealing images.
Additionally, Visual ChatGPT is employed to refine the generated images gradually, ensuring consistency in artistic style across all panels. This method is chosen over manual drawing because AI-based tools provide faster iterations, enhanced creative flexibility, and improved precision. AI models like DALL-E 3 can generate well-aligned, accurate images when guided by detailed prompts and structured input. To ensure that others can understand the results of this process, all AI-generated images from OpenAI were carefully documented to make it easy to reproduce the same method. This study demonstrates that blending structured storytelling with AI-generated visuals significantly enhances creative collaboration between humans and machines, paving the way for future innovations.
